This is a Virtual Kitchen website.
Includes a Homepage ( index.php), which includes a search button for exsisting recipes that have been uploaded by the cooks, along with each recipe being displayed on this page.
The cooks can sign in, which takes them to a dashboard, where they can view thier recipes, add a new recipe with details, which then is directly input into the database, or htey can update an exsisting recipe. 
The users of this website can click onto the recipes page on the navigation bar, which will show the ingredients, method and supply an image for each recipe for them to follow. 
The link to open and navigate through the website: http://240130808.cs2410-web01pvm.aston.ac.uk/Portfolio%203/index.php 
This is my fist full developed website, with a linked database, so there are loopholes, but it is a learning curve.
